                    <br>
                    <br>RnD (Rise and Dance) is a Pepperdine Community Dance Club. 
                    The purpose of RnD Dance is to allow students to expand 
                    and foster their skills in dance while participating in a 
                    friendly, accepting, and engaging social activity. We 
                    incorporate a wide range of dance styles such as hip-hop, 
                    jazz, and K-pop styles in our routines. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Our community classes are open to everyone regardless of 
                    dance level and our crew regularly trains and performs at 
                    different shows.
